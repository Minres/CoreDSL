# Introduction

CoreDSL 2 is a domain-specific language to model processor cores at the level of their *instruction set architecture* (ISA).
Its use cases include the generation of ISA-specific artifacts for compilers, instruction set simulators (ISS) and other validation purposes, as well as the the user-friendly specification of custom ISA extensions (ISAX) in conjunction with a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool.
Note that we consider supporting the generation of a *complete* core implementation solely from CoreDSL 2 to be a *non-goal*, as the language currently does not express any micro-architectural details.
